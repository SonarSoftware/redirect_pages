# Redirect Page Templates

This repository contains a few, simple redirect page templates that you can use for your ISP. Just download the HTML and host it on a local server, and then modify the placeholder image with your logo, and update the text to display anything you like.

These pages are responsive and designed to work well on a mobile device or desktop.
